README
======

Quick README for the second AADS hand-in assignment.

Layout of source code
---------------------

bnb/
 |- lib (Contains ProGAL.jar and lpsolve55.jar)
 |- src (contains all the source code
 |- bin (will be created by ant compile target)
 |- build.xml 

Everything should be able to be invoking the ant target

	ant run

An obvious potential compilation problems, is that lpsolve55.jar is not compiled
for the right architecture. Replacing the .jar in the lib folder with a version
compiled for the architecture on which it's supposed to run on, should fix the
problem.
