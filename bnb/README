README

Quick README for the second AADS hand-in assignment.

Layout of source code
---------------------

bnb/
 |- lib (Contains ProGAL.jar and lpsolve55.jar)
 |- src (contains all the source code
 |- bin (will be created by ant compile target)
 |- build.xml 

Everything should be able to be invoking the ant target

	ant run

An obvious potential compilation problems, is that lpsolve55.jar is not compiled
for the right architecture. Replacing the .jar in the lib folder with a version
compiled for the architecture on which it's supposed to run on, should fix the
problem.

Usage
-----
To try out the different lower bound calculation methods, edit the MainMethods
class to indicate which method to use.

We extracted the 'lowerBound' method into an interface (think of it as a
strategy), and provide the following classes that implement a lower bound
calculation:

 - SimpleStrategy
 - OneTreeStrategy
 - OneTreeStrategyVx, where x is a number in the range: { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }
 - ZonesLowerBound
 - RelaxILPLowerBound

To facilitate this, we added a second argument to BranchAndBound_TSP's
constructor.

Simply substitute the second argument of BranchAndBound_TSP's constructor with
the desired strategy implementation. Example:

	... = new BranchAndBound_TSP(g, new RelaxILPLowerBound());

NOTE All versions of OneTreeStrategy take the graph g as argument. Example:

	... = new BranchAndBound_TSP(g, new OneTreeStrategyV6(g));

Fix
---
We added a 'fix' to get the visualization working and a small class called
NPoint.
