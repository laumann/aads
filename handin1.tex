\maketitle

The problem could be formulated and solved as a max-flow
problem. There are a few things to observe before that: the network
(as in the example) is undirected, in which case we would want to make
it directed. We also have several sources that may themselves be
connected (such as nodes 2 and 3 in the example).

%%  Let the network be an undirected graph called $N = (V,E)$. We want to
%% construct a max-flow graph $G = (V_G, E_G)$ from $N$. For all the
%% edges $u,v \in V$, we let $u,v \in V_G$, and $(u,v), (v,u) \in
%% E_G$. If we let $k$ denote the capacity of the edge $(u,v)\in E$, then
%% we let $c(u,v) = c(v,u) = k$ in $G$. Finally we attach a common source
%% to all the nodes that were sources in $N$, call it $s$, and we let
%% $c(s,u) = \infty$ for all the nodes $u$ that were sources in $N$.

Let the network be an undirected graph called $N = (V,E)$. We want to
construct a max-flow graph $G = (V',E')$ from $N$. For all nodes
$u,v\in V$ and $(u,v)\in E$, we add to our max-flow 
graph nodes $u, v$ and an extra node $w$. We add add directed edges
$(u,v), (v,w)$ and $(w,u)$. If we let $k$ denote the capacity of the
edge $(u,v)\in E$, then we let $c(u,v) = c(v,w) = c(w,u) = k$ in
$G$. Lastly, we add a super source $s$ and an edge $(s,v)$ to all the
nodes $v$ that were a source in $N$.

The number of edges in $G$ is $|V'| = |V| + |E| + 1 $ and $|E'| = 3|E|
+ p$, where $p$ is the number of edges added from the super source
$s$. $p$ is exactly the number of sources in $N$.

Now we have the original problem stated as a max-flow problem, which
can be easily expressed as a linear program

\[
\begin{array}{lrcll}
\textrm{max.:} & \displaystyle\sum_{v\in V_G} f(s,v) -\displaystyle\sum_{v\in V_G} f(v,s) &     & & \\
\textrm{s.t.:} &  f(u,v)                &\leq & c(u,v),  &\forall u,v\in V_G\\
              &  \displaystyle\sum_{v\in V_G}f(v,u) -\displaystyle\sum_{v\in V_G}f(u,v)                & =   & 0 &\forall u,v\in V_G\\
              & f(u,v) & = & 0, &\forall u,v\in V_G
\end{array}
\]

As small example graph can be found in fig.\ref{fig:exg}.

\end{figure}

The linear program corresponding to the graph in fig.~\ref{fig:exg} is
the following:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcll}
\textrm{max.:} & f_{s,v_1} + f_{s,v_2} & & &\\
\textrm{s.t.:} & f_{s,v_1} &\leq & c(s,v_1) = 5&\\
               & f_{s,v_2} &\leq & c(s,v_2) = 10&\\
               & f_{v_1,v_3} &\leq & c(v_1,v_3) = 7&\\
               & f_{v_2,v_3} &\leq & c(v_1,v_3) = 7&\\
               & f_{v_2,t} &\leq & c(v_2,t) = 3&\\
               & f_{v_3,t} &\leq & c(v_3,t) = 12&\\
               & f_{s,v_1} &= &f_{v_1,v_3}&\\
               & f_{s,v_2} &= &f_{v_2,v_3} + f_{v_2,t}&\\
               & f_{v_1,v_3} + f_{v_2,v_3} &= &f_{v_3,t}&\\
& f_{s,v_1}, f_{s,v_2},f_{v_1,v_3},f_{v_2,v_3},f_{v_2,t}, f_{v_3,t} & \geq & 0\\
\end{array}
\]

We have minimized the above linear program, such that edges with
capacity zero have been omitted. Without showing the work of the
simplex algorithm, we arrive at the solution: $f_{s,v_1} = 5, f_{s,v_2} =
10$.

In order to find the cheapest critical connection we have to identify
the \emph{minimal cuts}. Intuitively, if we have a cut $(S, T)$ of our
graph and a maximum flow $f$ in that same graph, then the flow from
$S$ to $T$ must be equal to capacity across that cut, $c(S,T)$. This
means in order to increase the overall flow of the graph, we have to
increase the capacities on some of the edges of our minimal cuts.

If we only have one such minimal cut, then we simply select the edge
with the smallest capacity and increase its capacity. If we have more
than one cut, it's not immediately clear which edges to choose.

In our example above, we can identify three minimal cuts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $S_1 = \{s\}$, $T_1 = V - \{s\}$
  \item $S_2 = \{s,v_2\}$, $T_2 = \{v_1,v_3,t \}$
  \item $S_3 = V - \{t\}$, $T_3 = \{t\}$.
\end{enumerate}

In the first cut we can identify the edge $(s, v_1)$, $c(s,v_1) = 5$,
as the cheapest to increase, for $(S_2,T_2)$ the cheapest edge is
$(v_2,t)$, $c(v_2,t) = 3$, and this is also the cheapest to increase
for $(S_3, T_3)$. If we increase the capacities of these two edges by
1, then we have increased the capacities of all the minimal cuts
$(S_i,T_i)$ by 1. In this example the above cuts are still minimal
cuts, so the max-flow min-cut theorem tells us that we have increased
the maximum flow by 1 (otherwise we should have provoked another
minimal cut).

Recaptured briefly, in order to find the ``cheapest critical
connection'', we need to inspect the minimal cuts and for each of
them, select the edge with the smallest capacity to increase. In the
end, by the max-flow min-cut property, we will have increased the
maximum flow in the entire graph.


The dual of the above stated problem can be stated by restating the
above program in standard form $Ax\leq b$ along with a coefficent
vector $c = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}^T$. The
  dual is then given by $A^Ty \geq c$, where we minimize $b^Ty$. $y$
  is a vector of size proportional to the number of constraints, in
  our case 12, because each of the equality constraints give rise to
  two inequalities. Now we can state the dual:

\[
\begin{array}{cl}
\textrm{min.:} & 5y_1 + 10y_2 + 7y_3 + 7y_4 + 3y_5 + 12y_6\\
\textrm{s.t.:} &
 \begin{bmatrix}%
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}y
\geq
\begin{pmatrix}
  1\\ 1\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
%%\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 2\end{pmatrix}
\end{array}
\]
A solution to the dual problem is $y_1 = 1, y_2 = 1$ and the rest are
zero.

In order to find cheapest critical connection, 


\vfill
 
%% A company maintains a computer network where multiple workstations
%% often have to send large amounts of data to a single server through a
%% sequence of relay stations (see Figure 1 for an example). Each
%% connection between computers/relays has a fixed upper bound on the
%% transfer rate of data.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Give a precise explanation how the company could efficiently determine
the largest transfer rate to the server. 

\item Write a linear program that finds this transfer rate

\item Give a small example graph and write the optimal solution to the
linear program given above.  

\item The cost of increasing the capacity of a connection with one unit is
directly proportional to the capacity of that connection.  

Give a precise explanation how the company could efficiently determine
the cheapest 'critical connection' to improve in order to get a better
maximum transfer rate from the workstations to the server.  

\item Write the dual of the linear program you gave before and find the
optimal solution in the example you created before.   

\item How could the critical connections be determined from the dual?

\item Some of the relay stations are not owned by the company, so they have
to pay a leasing price of 1 øre for each byte transferred in and out
of the company’s network (see Figure 2 for an example).  

Assuming that the company has already determined the maximum transfer
rate, and wants to maintain this, give a linear program that finds the
lowest possible price they will have to pay for it.

\item Attached is a Java class (Network.java) specifying a network as just
described.

Report both the largest bit rate and the lowest leasing-price for this
problem and give a brief description of how you obtained this
result. It is preferrable if you use a linear programming package that
can be called from your programming language of choice. The second
assignment will require this as well.
